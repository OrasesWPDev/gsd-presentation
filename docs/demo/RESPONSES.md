## Usage

During `/gsd:new-project`, GSD will ask questions to understand your project. These are the pre-written responses for the Pomodoro timer demo.

Keep answers short. GSD will elaborate and ask follow-ups.

**Demo Note:** We use 30-second timers so the audience can see the session counter increment live.
